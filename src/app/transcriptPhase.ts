 * the uniform-sample portion of the map now starts the moment the run is
 * live, and the event-anchored portion follows once the scan has produced
 * reaction peaks. The checkpoint-resume machinery that already survives a
 * refresh is what carries the hand-off: the second phase subtracts whatever
 * the first phase persisted and transcribes only the remainder.
